<p>One of the first, and most important questions, I think people have about crime is a simple one: is crime going up? Answering it seems simple - you just count up all the crimes that happen in an area and see if that number of bigger than it was in previous times.</p>
<p>However, putting this into practice invites a number of questions, all of which affect how we measure crime. First, we need to define what a crime is? Not philosophically what actions are crimes - or what should be crimes - but literally which of the many thousands of different criminal acts (crimes as defined by state law) should be considered in this measure. Should murder count? Most people would say yes. How about jaywalking or speeding? Many would say probably not. Should marital rape be considered a crime? Now, certainly most people (all, I would hope) would say yes. But in much of the United States it wasn’t a crime until the 1970s <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-bennice2003marital" role="doc-biblioref">Bennice and Resick 2003</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-mcmahon2009criminalizing" role="doc-biblioref">McMahon-Howard, Clay-Warner, and Renzulli 2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Next, we have to know what geographic and time unit to measure crimes at since these decisions determine how precise we can measure crime and when it changed. That is, if you are mugged on Jan 1st at exactly 12:15pm right outside your house, how do we record it? Should we be as precise as including the exactly time and location (your home address or coordinates for the address)? Out of privacy concerns to the victim, should we only include a larger time unit (such as hour of the day or just the day without any time of day) or a larger geographic unit (such as a Census Tract or the city)?</p>
<p>The final question is that when a crime occurs, how do we know? That is, when we want to count how many crimes occurred do we ask people how often they’ve been victimized, do we ask people how often they commit a crime, do we look at crimes reported to police, crimes charged in a criminal court? Each of these measures will likely give different answers as to how many crimes occurred.</p>
<p>The FBI answered all of these questions in 1929 when they began the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program Data, or UCR data for short. <strong>Crime consists of eight crime categories - murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, theft, and simple assault - that are reported to the police and is collected each month from each agency in the country.</strong> These decisions, born primarily out of the resource limitations of 1929 (e.g. no computers), have had a major impact on criminology research. The first seven crime categories - known as “Index Crimes” or “Part 1 crimes” (or “Part I” sometimes) - are the ones used to measure crime in many criminology papers, even when the researchers have access to data that covers a broader selection of crimes than these.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The crime data actually also includes the final crime, simple assault, though it is not included as an index crime and is, therefore, generally ignored by researchers - a relatively large flaw in most studies that we’ll discuss in more detail later.</p>
<p>If you think that decisions made nearly a century ago are probably not the most useful for current research - and they’re almost certainly not the decisions that you would have made - then you’ve struck at the core of this book. As researchers, we are relying on datasets whose creation was made so long ago that</p>
<div id="what-is-a-crime" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> What is a crime?</h2>
<p>UCR data covers only a subset - and for the crime data, a very small subset - of all crimes that can occur.</p>
<div id="crimes-included-in-the-ucr-datasets" class="section level3" number="2.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Crimes included in the UCR datasets</h3>
<p>As mentioned above - and as most criminology papers will tell you - the crimes included in the UCR’s Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data (which I like to call the “crime” dataset) are the seven index crimes (eight when including arson) - homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft - and simple assault. This is true but incomplete. The data also includes subcategories for all crimes other than theft - though theft has its own UCR dataset which goes into detail about the thefts. Both robbery and aggravated assault, for example, have subcategories showing which weapon the offender used (if any) during the crime. This allows for a more detailed understanding of the crime than looking only at the broad category. I’m not sure why most research includes only the broader categories and doesn’t tend to look at subcategories, but that seems to be the case in most studies that I have read. Some police agencies only report the broader categories and don’t report subcategories, but most report subcategories so this is an under-exploited source of data.</p>

<p>The crimes included in the Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race - the “arrest” data tells you how many people were arrested for a particular crime category - are different than those in the crime data. The arrest data covers a wider variety of crimes, including drug and alcohol crimes, gambling, and fraud. However, it is also less detailed than the crime dataset when it comes to violent crime. While it covers the same broad categories of violent crimes as the crimes data - murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault - it doesn’t include the more detailed breakdown that is available in the crime data. For example, in the crime data robbery is included as well as the subcategories of robbery with a gun, robbery with a knife, robbery with another dangerous weapon, and robbery without a weapon. In comparison, the arrest data only includes robbery without any subcategories.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> What is a violent crime?</h3>
<p>An important consideration in using this data is defining what a “violent crime” is. One definition, and the one that I think makes the most sense, is that a violent crime is one that uses force or the threat of force. For example, if I punch you in the face, that is a violent crime. If I stab you, that is a violent crime. While clearly different in terms of severity, both incidents used force so I believe would be classified as a violent crime. The FBI, and most researchers, reporters, and advocates would disagree. Organizations ranging from the <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/violent-crime">FBI itself</a> to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/20/facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/">Pew Research Center</a> and advocacy groups like the <a href="https://arresttrends.vera.org/data-sources-methodology">Vera Institute of Justice</a> and the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/tale_of_two_countries_racially_targeted_arrests_in_the_era_of_marijuana_reform_revised_7.1.20_0.pdf">ACLU</a> all define the first examine as a non-violent crime and the second as a violent crime. They do this for three main reasons.</p>
<p>The second reason is that it benefits some people’s goals to classify violent crime as only including index crimes. This is because simple assault is extremely common compared to violent index crimes - in most cities simple assault is more common than all violent index crimes put together - so excluding simple assault makes it seem like fewer arrests are violent than they are when including simple assault. For example, a number of articles have noted that marijuana arrests are more common than violent crime arrests <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-ingraham2016" role="doc-biblioref">Ingraham 2016</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-kertscher2019" role="doc-biblioref">Kertscher 2019</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-devito2020" role="doc-biblioref">Devito 2020</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-earlenbaugh2020" role="doc-biblioref">Earlenbaugh 2020</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-aclu2020" role="doc-biblioref">Edwards et al. 2020</a>)</span> or that violent crime arrests are only 5% of all arrests <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-neusteter2019every" role="doc-biblioref">Neusteter and O’Toole 2019</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-speri2019" role="doc-biblioref">Speri 2019</a>)</span>. While true when considering only violent index crimes, including simple assault as a violent crime makes these statements false. Some organizations call the violent index crimes “serious violent crimes” which is an improvement but even this is a misnomer since simple assault can lead to more serious harm than aggravated assault. An assault becomes aggravated if using a weapon or there is the <em>potential</em> for serious harm, even if no harm actually occurs.</p>

<div id="a-summary-of-each-ucr-dataset" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> A summary of each UCR dataset</h2>
<p>UCR data can be roughly summarized into two groups: crime data and arrest data. While there are several datasets included in the UCR data collection, they are all extensions of one of the above groups. For arrest data, you have information about who (by race and by age-gender, but not by race-gender or race-age other than within race you know if the arrestee is an adult or a juvenile). For crime data, you have monthly counts of a small number of crimes (many fewer than crimes covered in the arrest data) and then more specialized data on a subset of these crimes - information on homicides, hate crimes, assaults or deaths of police officers, and stolen property.</p>
<p>Each of these datasets will have its own chapter in this book where we discuss the data thoroughly. Here is a very brief summary of each dataset which will help you know which one to use for your research. I still recommend reading that data’s chapter since it covers important caveats and uses (or misuses) of the data that won’t be covered below. For example,</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> The data as you get it from the FBI</h2>
<p>We’ll finish this overview of the UCR data by briefly talking about format of the data that is released by the FBI, before the processing done by myself or <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/NACJD/index.html">NACJD</a> that converts the data to a type that software like R or Stata or Excel can understand. The FBI releases their data as fixed-width ASCII files which are basically just an Excel file but with all of the columns squished together. As an example, below is the data as you receive it from the FBI for the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset for 1960, the first year with data available. In the figure, it seems like there are multiple rows but that’s just because the software that I opened the file in isn’t wide enough - in reality what is shown is a single row that is extremely wide because there are over 1,500 columns in this data. If you scroll down enough you’ll see the next row, but that isn’t shown in the current image. What is shown is a single row with a ton of columns all pushed up next to each other. Since all of the columns are squished together (the gaps are just blank spaces because the value there is a space, but that doesn’t mean there is a in the data. Spaces are possible values in the data and are meaningful), you need some way to figure out which parts of the data belong in which column.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-2"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2.1: Fixed-width ASCII file for the 1960 Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset
</p>
</div>
<p>The “fixed-width” part of the file type is how this works (the ASCII part basically means it’s a text file). Each row is the same width - literally the same number of characters, including blank spaces. So you must tell the software you are using to process this file - by literally write code in something called a “setup file” but is basically just instructions for whatever software you use (R, SPSS, Stata, SAS can all do this) - which characters are certain columns. For example, in this data the first character says which type of UCR data it is (1 means the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data) and the next two characters (in the setup file written as 2-3 since it is characters 2 through 3 [inclusive]) are the state number (01 is the state code for Alabama). So we can read this row as the first column indicating it is an Offenses Known data, the second column indicating that it is for the state of Alabama, and so on for each of the remaining columns. To read in this data you’ll need a setup file that covers every column in the data (some software, like R, can handle just reading in the specific columns you want and don’t need to include every column in the setup file).</p>
<p>The second important thing to know about reading in a fixed-width ASCII file is something called a “value label.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> For example, in the above image we saw the characters 2-3 is the state and in the row we have the value “01” which means that the state is “Alabama.” Since this type of data is trying to be as small as efficient as possible, it often replaces longer values with shorter one and provides a translation for the software to use to convert it to the proper value when reading it. “Alabama” is more characters than “01” so it saves space to say “01” and just replace that with “Alabama” later on. So “01” would be the ‘value" and “Alabama” would be the ’label’ that it changes to once read.</p>
<p>Fixed-width ASCII files may seem awful to you reading it today, and it is awful to use. But it appears to be an efficient way to store data back many decades ago when data releases began but now is extremely inefficient - in terms of speed, file size, ease of use - compared to modern software so I’m not sure why they <em>still</em> release data in this format. But they do, and even the more <em>modern</em> (if starting in 1991, before I was born, is modern!) NIBRS data comes in this format. For you, however, the important part to understand is not how exactly to read this type of data, but to understand that people who made this data publicly available (such as myself and the team at NACJD) must made this conversion process.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <strong>This conversion process, from fixed-width ASCII to a useful format is the most dangerous step taken in using this data - and one that is nearly entirely unseen by researchers.</strong></p>
<p>Every line of code you write (or, for SPSS users, click you make) invites the possibility of making a mistake.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The FBI does not provide a setup file with the fixed-width ASCII data so to read in this data you need to make it yourself. Since some UCR data are massive, this involves assigning the column width for thousands of columns and the value labels for hundreds of different value labels.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> A typo anywhere could have potentially far-reaching consequences so this is a crucial weakpoint in the data cleaning process - and one in which I have not seen anything written about before. While I have been diligent in checking the setup files and my code to seek out any issues - and I know that NACJD has a robust checking process for their own work - that doesn’t mean our work is perfect.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Even with perfection in processing the raw data to useful files, decisions we make (e.g. what level to aggregate to, what is an outlier) can affect both what type of questions you can ask when using this data, and how well you can answer them.</p>
