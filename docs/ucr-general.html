<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Overview of the Data</h1>
<p>One of the first, and most important, questions I think people have about crime is a simple one: is crime going up? Answering it seems simple - you just count up all the crimes that happen in an area and see if that number of bigger than it was in previous times.</p>
<p>However, putting this into practice invites a number of questions, all of which affect how we measure crime. First, we need to define what a crime is? Not philosophically what actions are crimes - or what should be crimes - but literally which of the many thousands of different criminal acts (crimes as defined by state law) should be considered in this measure. Should murder count? Most people would say yes. How about jaywalking or speeding? Many would say probably not. Should marital rape be considered a crime? Now, certainly most people (all, I would hope) would say yes. But in much of the United States it wasn’t a crime until the 1970s <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-bennice2003marital" role="doc-biblioref">Bennice and Resick 2003</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-mcmahon2009criminalizing" role="doc-biblioref">McMahon-Howard, Clay-Warner, and Renzulli 2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Next, we have to know what geographic and time unit to measure crimes at since these decisions determine how precise we can measure crime and when it changed. That is, if you are mugged on Jan 1st at exactly 12:15pm right outside your house, how do we record it? Should we be as precise as including the exact time and location (your home address or coordinates for the address)? Out of privacy concerns to the victim, should we only include a larger time unit (such as hour of the day or just the day without any time of day) or a larger geographic unit (such as a Census Tract or the city)?</p>
<p>The final question is that when a crime occurs, how do we know? That is, when we want to count how many crimes occurred do we ask people how often they’ve been victimized, do we ask people how often they commit a crime, do we look at crimes reported to police, crimes charged in a criminal court? Each of these measures will likely give different answers as to how many crimes occurred.</p>
<p>The FBI answered all of these questions in 1929 when they began the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program Data, or UCR data for short. <strong>Crime consists of eight crime categories - murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, theft, and simple assault - that are reported to the police and is collected each month from each agency in the country.</strong> These decisions, born primarily out of the resource limitations of 1929 (e.g. no computers), have had a major impact on criminology research. The first seven crime categories - known as “Index Crimes” or “Part 1 crimes” (or “Part I” sometimes) - are the ones used to measure crime in many criminology papers, even when the researchers have access to data that covers a broader selection of crimes than these.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The crime data actually also includes the final crime, simple assault, though it is not included as an index crime and is, therefore, generally ignored by researchers - a relatively large flaw in most studies that we’ll discuss in more detail in Section @ref(index_crimes).</p>
<p>If you think that decisions made nearly a century ago are probably not the most useful for current research - and they’re almost certainly not the decisions that you would have made - then you’ve struck at the core of this book. As researchers, we are relying on datasets whose creation was made so long ago that</p>
<div id="crimes-included-in-the-ucr-datasets" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Crimes included in the UCR datasets</h2>
<p>UCR data covers only a subset - and for the crime data, a very small subset - of all crimes that can occur. It also only includes crimes reported to the police. So there are two levels of abstraction from a crime occurring to it being included in the data: a crime must occur that is one of the crimes included in the UCR collection (we detail all of these crimes below) <em>and</em> the victim must report the incident to the police. While the crimes included are only a small selection of crimes - which were originally chosen since at the time the UCR was designed these were considered important offenses and among the best reported - this is an important first step to understanding the data. In this section we’ll go over the crimes included in the two main UCR datasets: Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest and (which I like to call the “crime” dataset) and the Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race (the “arrests” dataset). These are the most commonly used UCR datasets and the stolen property and homicide datasets are simply more detailed subsets of these datasets. The hate crime dataset can cover a broader selection of offenses than in the crimes or arrests data, so we’ll discuss those in the hate crimes chapter.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Crimes in the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset</h3>
<p>As mentioned above - and as most criminology papers will tell you - the crimes included in the UCR’s Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data are the seven index crimes (eight when including arson, though arson is in its own dataset) - homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft - as well as simple assault. This is true but incomplete. The data also includes subcategories for all crimes other than theft - though theft has its own UCR dataset which goes into detail about the thefts. Both robbery and aggravated assault, for example, have subcategories showing which weapon the offender used (if any) during the crime. This allows for a more detailed understanding of the crime than looking only at the broad category. I’m not sure why most research includes only the broader categories and doesn’t tend to look at subcategories, but that seems to be the case in most studies that I have read. Some police agencies only report the broader categories and don’t report subcategories, but most report subcategories so this is an under-exploited source of data.</p>

<p>The crimes included in the Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race - the “arrest” data tells you how many people were arrested for a particular crime category - are different than those in the crime data. The arrest data covers a wider variety of crimes, including drug and alcohol crimes, gambling, and fraud. However, it is also less detailed than the crime dataset when it comes to violent crime. While it covers the same broad categories of violent crimes as the crimes data - murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault - it doesn’t include the more detailed breakdown that is available in the crime data. For example, in the crime data robbery is included as well as the subcategories of robbery with a gun, robbery with a knife, robbery with another dangerous weapon, and robbery without a weapon. In comparison, the arrest data only includes robbery without any subcategories.</p>

<div id="index_crimes" class="section level3" number="2.1.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> What is an index (or part 1) crime?</h3>
<p>One of the first (and seemingly last) thing that people tend to learn about UCR crime data is that it covers something called an “index crime.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Index crimes, sometimes written as Part 1 or Part I crimes, are the seven crimes originally chosen by the FBI to be included in their measure of crimes as these offenses were both considered serious and generally well-reported so would be a useful measure of crime. Index crimes are often broken down into property index crimes - burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft (and arson now, though that’s often not included and is poorly reported) - and violent index crimes (murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault). The “index” is simply that all of the crimes are summed up into a total count of crimes (violent, property, or total) for that police agency.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with index crimes is that it is simply the sum of 8 (or 7 since arson data usually isn’t available) crimes. Index crimes have a huge range in their seriousness - it includes, for example, both murder and theft - so summing up the crimes gives each crime equal weight. This is clearly wrong as 100 murders is more serious than 100 thefts. This is especially a problem as less serious crimes (theft mostly) are far more common than more serious crimes. In 2017, for example, there were 1.25 million violent index crimes in the United States. That same year had 5.5 million thefts. So using index crimes as your measure of crimes undercounts the seriousness of crimes. Looking at total index crimes is, in effect, mostly just looking at theft. Looking at violent index crimes mostly measures aggravated assault. This is especially a problem because it hides trends in violent crimes. San Francisco, as an example, has had a huge increase in index crimes in the last several years. When looking closer, that increase is driven almost entirely by the near doubling of theft since 2011. During the same years, index violent crimes have stayed fairly steady. So the city isn’t getting more dangerous - at least not in terms of violent index crimes increasing - but it appears like it is due to just looking at total index crimes.</p>
<p>While many researchers divide index crimes into violent and nonviolent categories, which helps but even this isn’t entirely sufficient. Take Chicago as an example. It is a city infamous for its large number of murders. But as a fraction of index crimes, Chicago has a rounding error worth of murders. Their 653 murders in 2017 is only 0.5% of total index crimes. For violent index crimes, murder makes up 2.2%. What this means is that changes in murder are very difficult to detect. If Chicago had no murders this year, but a less serious crime (such as theft) increased slightly, we couldn’t tell from looking at the number of index crimes, even from violent index crimes. As discussed in the below section, using this sample of crimes as the primary measure of crimes - and particularly of violent crimes - is also misleading as it excludes important - and highly common relative to index crimes - offenses, such as simple assault.</p>
<div id="what-is-a-violent-crime" class="section level4" number="2.1.3.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3.1</span> What is a violent crime?</h4>
<p>An important consideration in using this data is defining what a “violent crime” is. One definition, and the one that I think makes the most sense, is that a violent crime is one that uses force or the threat of force. For example, if I punch you in the face, that is a violent crime. If I stab you, that is a violent crime. While clearly different in terms of severity, both incidents used force so I believe would be classified as a violent crime. The FBI, and most researchers, reporters, and advocates would disagree. Organizations ranging from the <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/violent-crime">FBI itself</a> to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/20/facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/">Pew Research Center</a> and advocacy groups like the <a href="https://arresttrends.vera.org/data-sources-methodology">Vera Institute of Justice</a> and the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/tale-two-countries-racially-targeted-arrests-era-marijuana-reform">ACLU</a> all define the first examine as a non-violent crime and the second as a violent crime. They do this for three main reasons.</p>
<p>The first reason is that simple assault is not an index crime, so they don’t include it when measuring violent crime. It is almost a tautology in criminology that you use index crimes as the measure of crime since that’s just what people do. As far as I’m aware, this is really the main reason why researchers justify using index crimes: because people in the past used it so that’s just what is done now.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> This strikes me as a particularly awful way of doing anything, more so since simple assault data has been available almost as long as index crime data.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The second reason - and one that I think makes sense for reporters and advocates who are less familiar with the data, but should be unacceptable to researchers - is that people don’t know that simple assault is included, or at least don’t have easy access to it. Neither the FBI’s annual report <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/home">page</a> not their official <a href="https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/">crime data tool website</a> include simple assault since they only include index crimes. For people who rely only on these sources - and given that using the data itself requires at least some programming skills, I think this accounts for most users and certainly nearly all non-researchers - it is not possible to access simple assault crime data (arrest data does include simple assault on these sites).</p>
<p>The final reason is that it benefits some people’s goals to classify violent crime as only including index crimes. This is because simple assault is extremely common compared to violent index crimes - in most cities simple assault is more common than all violent index crimes put together - so excluding simple assault makes it seem like fewer arrests are violent than they are when including simple assault. For example, a number of articles have noted that marijuana arrests are more common than violent crime arrests <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-ingraham2016" role="doc-biblioref">Ingraham 2016</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-kertscher2019" role="doc-biblioref">Kertscher 2019</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-devito2020" role="doc-biblioref">Devito 2020</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-earlenbaugh2020" role="doc-biblioref">Earlenbaugh 2020</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-aclu2020" role="doc-biblioref">Edwards et al. 2020</a>)</span> or that violent crime arrests are only 5% of all arrests <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-neusteter2019every" role="doc-biblioref">Neusteter and O’Toole 2019</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-speri2019" role="doc-biblioref">Speri 2019</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> While true when considering only violent index crimes, including simple assault as a violent crime makes these statements false. Some organizations call the violent index crimes “serious violent crimes” which is an improvement but even this is a misnomer since simple assault can lead to more serious harm than aggravated assault. An assault becomes aggravated if using a weapon or there is the <em>potential</em> for serious harm, even if no harm actually occurs.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<div id="a-summary-of-each-ucr-dataset" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> A summary of each UCR dataset</h2>
<p>UCR data can be roughly summarized into two groups: crime data and arrest data. While there are several datasets included in the UCR data collection, they are all extensions of one of the above groups. For arrest data, you have information about who (by race and by age-gender, but not by race-gender or race-age other than within race you know if the arrestee is an adult or a juvenile). For crime data, you have monthly counts of a small number of crimes (many fewer than crimes covered in the arrest data) and then more specialized data on a subset of these crimes - information on homicides, hate crimes, assaults or deaths of police officers, and stolen property.</p>
<p>Each of these datasets will have its own chapter in this book where we discuss the data thoroughly. Here is a very brief summary of each dataset which will help you know which one to use for your research. I still recommend reading that data’s chapter since it covers important caveats and uses (or misuses) of the data that won’t be covered below.</p>
<div id="offenses-known-and-clearances-by-arrest" class="section level3" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest</h3>
<p>The Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset - often called Return A, “Offenses Known” or, less commonly, OKCA - is the oldest and most commonly used dataset and measures crimes reported to the police. For this reason it is used as the main measure of crime in the United States and I tend to call it the “crimes dataset.” This data includes the monthly number of crimes reported to the police or otherwise known to the police (e.g. discovered while on patrol) for a small selection of crimes, as well as the number of crimes cleared by arrest or by “exceptional means” (a relatively flawed and manipulable measure of whether the case is “solved”). It also covers the number reported but found by police to have not occurred. Since this data has monthly agency-level crime information it is often used to measure crime trends between police agencies and over time. The data uses something called a Hierarchy Rule which means that in incidents with multiple crimes, only the most serious is recorded - though in practice this affects only a small percent of cases, and primarily affects property crimes.</p>
</div>
<div id="arrests-by-age-sex-and-race" class="section level3" number="2.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race</h3>
<p>The Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race dataset - often called ASR or the “arrests data” - includes the monthly number of arrests for a variety of crimes and, unlike the crime data, breaks down this data by age and gender. This data includes a broader number of crime categories than the crime dataset (the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data) though is less detailed on violent crimes since it does not breakdown aggravated assault or robberies by weapon type as the Offenses Known data does. For each crime it says the number of arrests for each gender-age group with younger ages (15-24) showing the arrestee’s age to the year (e.g. age 16) and other ages grouping years together (e.g. age 25-29, 30-34, “under 10”). It also breaks down arrests by race-age by including the number of arrestees of each race (American Indian, Asian, Black, and White) are the only included races) and if the arrestee is a juvenile (&lt;18 years old) or an adult. The data does technically include a breakdown by ethnicity-age (e.g. juvenile-Hispanic, juvenile-non-Hispanic) but almost no agencies report this data (for many years zero agencies report ethnicity) so in practice the data does not include ethnicity. As the data includes counts of arrestees, people who are arrested multiple times are included in the data multiple times - it is not a measure of unique arrestees.</p>
</div>
<div id="law-enforcement-officers-killed-and-assaulted-leoka" class="section level3" number="2.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA)</h3>
<p>The Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted data, often called just by its acronym LEOKA, has two main purposes.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> First, it provides counts of employees employed by each agency - broken down by if they are civilian employees or sworn officers, and also broken down by gender. And second, it measures how many officers were assaulted or killed (including officers who die accidentally such as in a car crash) in a given month. The assault data is also broken down into shift type and type (e.g. alone, with a partner, on foot, in a car, etc.), the offender’s weapon, and type of call they are responding to (e.g. robbery, disturbance, traffic stop). The killed data simply says how many officers are killed feloniously (i.e. murdered) or died accidentally (e.g. car crash) in a given month. The employee information is at the year-level so you know, for example, how many male police officers were employed in a given year at an agency, but don’t know any more than that such as how many officers were on patrol, were detectives, were in special units, etc. This dataset is commonly used as a measure of police employees and is a generally reliable - though imperfect as we’ll see - measure of how many police are employed by a police agency. The second part of this data, measuring assaults and deaths, is more flawed with missing data issues and data error issues (e.g. more officers killed than employed in an agency).</p>
</div>
<div id="supplementary-homicide-reports-shr" class="section level3" number="2.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR)</h3>
<p>The Supplementary Homicide Reports dataset - often abbreviated to SHR - is the most detailed of the UCR datasets and provides information about the circumstances and participants (victim and offender demographics and relationship status) for homicides.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> For each homicide incident it tells you the age, gender, race, and ethnicity of each victim and offender as well as the relationship between the first victim and each of the offenders (but not the other victims in cases where there are multiple victims). It also tells you the weapon used by each offender and the circumstance of the killing, such as a “lovers triangle” or a gang-related murder. As with other UCR data, it also tells you the agency it occurred in and the month and year when the crime happened.</p>
</div>
<div id="hate-crime-data" class="section level3" number="2.2.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.5</span> Hate Crime Data</h3>
<p>This dataset covers crimes that are reported to the police and judged by the police to be motivated by hate More specifically, they are, first, crimes which were, second, motivated - at least in part - by bias towards a certain person or group of people because of characteristics about them such as race, sexual orientation, or religion. The first part is key, they must be crimes - and really must be the selection of crimes that the FBI collects for this dataset. Biased actions that don’t meet the standard of a crime, or are of a crime not included in this data, are not considered hate crimes. For example, if someone yells at a Black person and uses racial slurs against them, it is clearly a racist action. For it to be included in this data, however, it would have to extend to a threat since “intimidation” is a crime included in this data but lesser actions such as simply insulting someone is not included. For the second part, the bias motivation, it must be against a group that the FBI includes in this data. When this data collection began crimes against transgender people were not counted so if a transgender person was assaulted or killed because they were transgender, this is not a hate crime recorded in the data.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>So this data is really a narrower measure of hate crimes than it might seem. In practice it is (some) crimes motivated by (some) kinds of hate that are reported to the police. It is also the most under-reported UCR dataset with most agencies not reporting any hate crimes to the FBI. This leads to huge gaps in the data with some states having zero agencies report crime, agencies reporting some bias motivations but not others, agencies reporting some years but not others. While these problems exist for all of the UCR datasets, it is most severe in this data. This problem is exacerbated by hate crimes being rare even in agencies that report them - with such rare events, even minor changes in which agencies report or which types of offenses they include can have large effects.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.6</span> Property Stolen and Recovered (Supplement to Return A)</h3>
<p>The Property Stolen and Recovered data - sometimes called the Supplement to Return A (Return A being another name for the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset, the “crime” dataset) - provides monthly information about property-related offenses (theft, motor vehicle theft, robbery, and burglary), including the location of the offense (in broad categories like “gas station” or “residence), what was stolen (e.g. clothing, livestock, firearms), and how much the stolen items were worth.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The”recovered" part of this dataset covers the type and value of property recovered so you can use this, along with the type and value of property stolen, to determine what percent and type of items the police managed to recover. Like other UCR datasets this is at the agency-month level so you can, for example, learn how often burglaries occur at the victim’s home during the day, and if that rate changes over the year or differs across agencies. The data, however, provides no information about the offender or the victim (other than if the victim was an individual or a commercial business [based on the location of the incident - “bank,” “gas station,” etc]). The value of the property stolen is primarily based on the victim’s estimate of how much the item is worth (items that are decreased in value once used - such as cars - are supposed to be valued at the current market rate, but the data provides no indication of when it uses the current market rate or the victim’s estimate) so it should be used as a very rough estimate of value.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.7</span> Arson</h3>
<p>The arson dataset provides monthly counts at the police agency-level for arsons that occur, and includes a breakdown of arsons by the type of arson (e.g. arson of a person’s home, arson of a vehicle, arson of a community/public building) and the estimated value of the damage caused by the arson. This data includes all arsons reported to the police or otherwise known to the police (e.g. discovered while on patrol) and also has a count of arsons that lead to an arrest (of at least one person who committed the arson) and reports that turned out to not be arsons (such as if an investigation found that the fire was started accidentally). For each type of arson it includes the number of arsons where the structure was uninhabited or otherwise not in use, so you can estimate the percent of arsons of buildings which had the potential to harm people. This measure is for structures where people normally did not inhabit the structure - such as a vacant building where no one lives. A home where no one is home <em>at the time of the arson</em> does not count as an uninhabited building. In cases where the arson led to a death, that death would be recorded as a murder on the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset - but not indicated anywhere on this dataset. If an individual who responds to the arson dies because of it, such as a police officer or a firefighter, this is not considered a homicide (though the officer death is still included in the Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted data) unless the arsonists intended to cause their deaths. Even though the UCR uses the Hierarchy Rule, where only the most serious offense that occurs is recorded, all arsons are reported - arson is except fro the Hierarchy Rule.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> How to identify a particular agency (ORI codes)</h2>
<p>In the UCR and other FBI data sets, agencies are identified using <strong>OR</strong>iginating Agency <strong>I</strong>dentifiers or an ORI. An ORI is a unique ID code used to identify an agency.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> If we used the agency’s name we’d end up with some duplicates since there can be multiple agencies in the country (and in a state, those this is very rare) with the same name. For example, if you looked for the Philadelphia Police Department using the agency name, you’d find both the “Philadelphia Police Department” in Pennsylvania and the one in Mississippi. Each ORI is a 7-digit value starting with the state abbreviation (for some reason the FBI incorrectly puts the abbreviation for Nebraska as NB instead of NE) followed by 5 numbers.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> When dealing with specific agencies, make sure to use the ORI rather than the agency name to avoid any mistakes. In this book when discussing a particular agency I’ll generally refer to it both by name and by ORI, but in the code used to generate figures and tables I identify that agency through their ORI code.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>For an easy way to find the ORI number of an agency, use <a href="http://crimedatatool.com/crosswalk.html">this page</a> on my site. Type an agency name or an ORI code into the search section and it will return everything that is a match.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> The data as you get it from the FBI</h2>
<p>We’ll finish this overview of the UCR data by briefly talking about format of the data that is released by the FBI, before the processing done by myself or <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/NACJD/index.html">NACJD</a> that converts the data to a type that software like R or Stata or Excel can understand. The FBI releases their data as fixed-width ASCII files which are basically just an Excel file but with all of the columns squished together. As an example, below is the data as you receive it from the FBI for the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset for 1960, the first year with data available. In the figure, it seems like there are multiple rows but that’s just because the software that I opened the file in isn’t wide enough - in reality what is shown is a single row that is extremely wide because there are over 1,500 columns in this data. If you scroll down enough you’ll see the next row, but that isn’t shown in the current image. What is shown is a single row with a ton of columns all pushed up next to each other. Since all of the columns are squished together (the gaps are just blank spaces because the value there is a space, but that doesn’t mean there is a in the data. Spaces are possible values in the data and are meaningful), you need some way to figure out which parts of the data belong in which column.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The “fixed-width” part of the file type is how this works (the ASCII part basically means it’s a text file). Each row is the same width - literally the same number of characters, including blank spaces. So you must tell the software you are using to process this file - by literally write code in something called a “setup file” but is basically just instructions for whatever software you use (R, SPSS, Stata, SAS can all do this) - which characters are certain columns. For example, in this data the first character says which type of UCR data it is (1 means the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data) and the next two characters (in the setup file written as 2-3 since it is characters 2 through 3 [inclusive]) are the state number (01 is the state code for Alabama). So we can read this row as the first column indicating it is an Offenses Known data, the second column indicating that it is for the state of Alabama, and so on for each of the remaining columns. To read in this data you’ll need a setup file that covers every column in the data (some software, like R, can handle just reading in the specific columns you want and don’t need to include every column in the setup file).</p>
<p>The second important thing to know about reading in a fixed-width ASCII file is something called a “value label.”<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> For example, in the above image we saw the characters 2-3 is the state and in the row we have the value “01” which means that the state is “Alabama.” Since this type of data is trying to be as small as efficient as possible, it often replaces longer values with shorter one and provides a translation for the software to use to convert it to the proper value when reading it. “Alabama” is more characters than “01” so it saves space to say “01” and just replace that with “Alabama” later on. So “01” would be the ‘value" and “Alabama” would be the ’label’ that it changes to once read.</p>
<p>Fixed-width ASCII files may seem awful to you reading it today, and it is awful to use. But it appears to be an efficient way to store data back many decades ago when data releases began but now is extremely inefficient - in terms of speed, file size, ease of use - compared to modern software so I’m not sure why they <em>still</em> release data in this format. But they do, and even the more <em>modern</em> (if starting in 1991, before I was born, is modern!) NIBRS data comes in this format. For you, however, the important part to understand is not how exactly to read this type of data, but to understand that people who made this data publicly available (such as myself and the team at NACJD) must made this conversion process.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> <strong>This conversion process, from fixed-width ASCII to a useful format is the most dangerous step taken in using this data - and one that is nearly entirely unseen by researchers.</strong></p>
<p>Every line of code you write (or, for SPSS users, click you make) invites the possibility of making a mistake.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The FBI does not provide a setup file with the fixed-width ASCII data so to read in this data you need to make it yourself. Since some UCR data are massive, this involves assigning the column width for thousands of columns and the value labels for hundreds of different value labels.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> A typo anywhere could have potentially far-reaching consequences, so this is a crucial weakpoint in the data cleaning process - and one in which I have not seen anything written about before. While I have been diligent in checking the setup files and my code to seek out any issues - and I know that NACJD has a robust checking process for their own work - that doesn’t mean our work is perfect.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Even with perfection in processing the raw data to useful files, decisions we make (e.g. what level to aggregate to, what is an outlier) can affect both what type of questions you can ask when using this data, and how well you can answer them.</p>
