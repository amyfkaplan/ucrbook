# Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA) {#leoka}

The Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted data, often called just by its acronym LEOKA, has two main purposes.^[This data is also sometimes called the "Police Employees" dataset.] First, it provides counts of employees employed by each agency - broken down by if they are civilian employees or sworn officers, and also broken down by gender. And second it measures how many officers were assaulted or killed (including officers who die accidentally such as in a car crash) in a given month - this is broken down into shift type and type (e.g. alone, with a partner, on foot, in a car, etc.), the offender's weapon, and type of call they are responding to (e.g. robbery, disturbance, traffic stop).

The employee information is at the year-level so you know, for example, how many male police officers were employed in a given year at an agency, but don't know any more than that such as how many officers were on patrol, were detectives, were in special units, etc. This dataset is commonly used as a measure of police employees and is a generally reliable - though imperfect as we'll see - measure of how many police are employed by a police agency. 
The second part of this data, measuring assaults and deaths,  is more flawed with missing data issues and data error issues (e.g. more officers killed than employed in an agency). We'll get into these issues in more detail during this chapter.

This data, as well as the privately-run site [Officer Down Memorial Page](https://www.odmp.org/) which covers law enforcement officers who have died, has also been used lately in the context of police using force against people out of fear of being harmed by that person. The discussion revolves around whether police are actually in high danger of being harmed by comparing the rate at which officers die to that of other professions. In general they find that police officers are among the most likely profession to die but are not at the top of this measure.
