UCR data is, with the exception of the more detailed data that only covers murders, a monthly number of crimes or arrests reported to a single police agency which is then gathered by the FBI into one file that includes all reporting agencies. Think of your home town. This data will tell you how many crimes were reported for a small number of crimes or how many people (broken down by age, sex, and race) were arrested for a (larger) set of crimes in that city (if the city has multiple police agencies, it will use the agency which is the primary agency on the case, usually the local police department) in a given month. This is a very broad measure of crime, and its uses in research - or understanding crime at all - is fairly limited. Yet is has become - and will likely remain among researchers for at least the next decade - the most important crime data in the United States. UCR data is important for three reasons: The definitions are standard and all agencies follow them so you can compare across agencies and over time The data is available since 1960 so there is a long period of available data The data is available for most of the 18,000 police agencies in the United States so you can compare across agencies For most of this book well be discussing the caveats of the above reasons - or, more directly, why these assumptions are wrong - but these are the reasons why the data is so influential. 1.1 Motivation By the end of each chapter you should have a firm grasp on the dataset the covered and how to use it properly. However, this book cant possibly cover every potential use case for the data so make sure to carefully examine the data for your own particular use. This benefits you because youll know your data better and become a better research because of it. This benefits me because itll increase the quality of research in my field. I get a lot of emails from people asking questions about this data so part of my motivation for writing this book is to create a single place that answers as many questions as I can about the data. Again, this is among the most commonly used crime datasets and there are still many current papers published with incorrect information about the data (including such simple aspects like what geographic unit data is in and what time unit it is in). So hopefully this book will decrease the amount of misconceptions about this data, increasing overall research quality.1 1.2 Structure of the book This remainder of this book will be divided into eight chapters: an intro chapter briefly summarizing each dataset and going over overall issues with UCR data, six chapters each covering one of the six UCR datasets, and a final one covering county-level data, a highly flawed but common use of the UCR data. Each chapter will follow the same format: well start with a history of the data such as when it first because available and important changes in definitions or variables. Next well discuss what the data looks like initially when you get it from the FBI - literally what it looks like in its fixed-width ASCII format you get from the FBI and what it looks like (what each row and column mean) once its turned into a useful format that can be read into modern software like R and Stata.2 For most of the datasets this is a minor process but for data like the arrest or homicide datasets, the conversion process is harder - and this can actually lead to changes in the resulting data. For example, in an old version of the arrest data that I released, I aggregated certain arrestee ages together since my laptop at the time couldnt handle converting data from ASCII to R and Stata without aggregating the ages (more age groups means more columns which means more computer memory needed). So anyone using that data would have less detailed data than the current dataset. Understanding how the data moves from its rawest form (which in this case is after cleaning by the FBI) is important for being able to truly understand the data and its caveats. However, this is a fairly technical part of each chapter so feel free to skip it. Next in each chapter, well cover the variables included in the data and how to use them properly (including not using them at all) - this will be the bulk of each chapter. Well end each chapter by briefly summarizing the data, how and when its useful, and - most importantly - when you shouldnt use it. Since manuals are boring, Ill try to include graphs and images to try to alleviate the boredom. That said, I dont think its possible to make it too fun so sorry in advanced. This book is a mix of facts about the data, such as how many years are available, and my opinions about it, such as whether it is reliable. In cases of facts Ill just say a statement - e.g. the offenses data is available since 1960. In cases of opinion Ill temper the statement by saying something like in my opinion 1.3 Citing this book If this book was useful in your research, please cite it.

BibTeX format: @Book{ title = {Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program Data: A Practitioner's Guide}, author = {Jacob Kaplan}, year = {2021}, url = {https://ucrbook.com}, } 1.4 Sources of UCR data There are a few different sources of UCR data available today. First, and probably most commonly used, is the data put together by the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD)). This a team of out of the University of Michigan who manages a huge number of criminal justice datasets and makes them available to the public. If you have any questions about crime data - UCR or other data - I highly recommend you reach out to them for answers. They have a collection of data and excellent documentation available for UCR data available on their site here. One limitation to their data, however, is that each year of data is available as an individual file meaning that youll need to concatenate each year together into a single file. Some years also have different column names (generally minor changes like spelling robbery rob one year and robb the next) which requires more work to standardize before you could concatenate. They also only have data through 2016 which means that the most recent years (UCR data is available through 2019) of data are (as of this writing) unavailable. Next, and most usable for the general public but limited to researchers, is the FBIs official website Crime Data Explorer. On this site you can chose an agency and see annual crime data (remember, UCR data is monthly so this isnt as detailed as it can be) for certain crimes. This is okay for the general public but only provides a fraction of the data available in the actual data so is really not good for researchers. Finally, I have my own collection of UCR data available publicly on openICPSR, a site which allows people to submit their data for public access. For each of these datasets Ive taken the raw data from the FBI (for early years of homicide data this is actually from NACJD since the FBIs raw data is wrong and cant be parsed. For later years of homicide data this is from the FBIs raw data.) and read it into R. Since the data is only available from the FBI as fixed-width ASCII files, I created a setup file (well explain exactly how reading in this kind of data works in the next chapter) and read the data and then very lightly cleaned the data (i.e. only removing extreme outliers like an agency having millions of arsons in a month). For each of these datasets I detail what Ive done to the data and briefly summarize the data (i.e. a very short version of this book) on the datas page on openICPSR. The main advantage is that all my data has standard variable names and column names and, for data that is small enough, provide the data as a single file that has all years. For large datasets like the arrest data I break it down into parts of the data and not all years in a single file. The downside is that I dont provide documentation other than whats on the openICPSR page and only provide data in R and Stata format. I also have a similar site to the FBIs Crime Data Explorer but with more variables available, that site is available here. Its worth mentioning a final source of UCR information. This is the annual Crimes in the United States report released by the FBI each year around the start of October.3 As an example, here is the website for the 2019 report. In this report is summarized data which in most cases estimates missing data and provides information about national and subnational (though rarely city-level) crime data. As with the FBIs site it is only a fraction of the true data available so is not a very useful source of crime data. Still, this is a very common source of information used by researchers. 1.5 Where to find the data used in this book The data I am using in this book is the cleaned (well discuss in more detail exactly what I did to clean each dataset in the datasets chapter but the short answer is that I did very little.) and concatenated data that I put together from the raw data that the FBI releases. That data is available on my website here. I am hosting this book through GitHub which has a maximum file size allowed that is far smaller than these data so youll need to go to my site to download the data, its not available through this books GitHub repo. For some examples Im using the data before I cleaned it of outliers (as an example of the outliers present before I removed them) so that data is not publicly available. 1.6 NIBRS data Another source of FBI data, and one sometimes considered part of the UCR data collection, is the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data. Like its name implies this is an incident-level dataset which has detailed information about each incident reported to the police, including incident circumstances, and victim and offender information. This is also the data that the FBI has declared will replace UCR data starting in 2021, meaning that they will no longer collect UCR data and only allow agencies to submit NIBRS data. NIBRS data is a complex and highly rich dataset that deserves its own book to really understand, so I will not be discussing it any further in this book. Ideally, this will also decrease the number of emails and increase the number of citations I receive. To look at the data in its fixed-width ASCII format Ill use the program Notepad which can open up text files like ASCII files. For looking at the machine-readable format Ill use R since I think its a bit better looking than viewing it in Stata. In both cases, these will be images included in the chapter - you wont need to follow along or use either program. They also release a report about the first 6-months of the most recent year of data before the October release but this is generally an estimate from a sample of agencies so is far less useful.

Answering it seems simple - you just count up all the crimes that happen in an area and see if that number of bigger than it was in previous times. However, putting this into practice invites a number of questions, all of which affect how we measure crime. First, we need to define what a crime is? Not philosophically what actions are crimes - or what should be crimes - but literally which of the many thousands of different criminal acts (crimes as defined by state law) should be considered in this measure. Should murder count? Most people would say yes. How about jaywalking or speeding? Many would say probably not. Should marital rape be considered a crime? Now, certainly most people (all, I would hope) would say yes. But in much of the United States it wasnt a crime until the 1970s (Bennice and Resick 2003; McMahon-Howard, Clay-Warner, and Renzulli 2009). Next, we have to know what geographic and time unit to measure crimes at since these decisions determine how precise we can measure crime and when it changed. That is, if you are mugged on Jan 1st at exactly 12:15pm right outside your house, how do we record it? Should we be as precise as including the exactly time and location (your home address or coordinates for the address)? Out of privacy concerns to the victim, should we only include a larger time unit (such as hour of the day or just the day without any time of day) or a larger geographic unit (such as a Census Tract or the city)? The final question is that when a crime occurs, how do we know? That is, when we want to count how many crimes occurred do we ask people how often theyve been victimized, do we ask people how often they commit a crime, do we look at crimes reported to police, crimes charged in a criminal court? Each of these measures will likely give different answers as to how many crimes occurred. The FBI answered all of these questions in 1929 when they began the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program Data, or UCR data for short. Crime consists of eight crime categories - murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, theft, and simple assault - that are reported to the police and is collected each month from each agency in the country. These decisions, born primarily out of the resource limitations of 1929 (e.g. no computers), have had a major impact on criminology research. The first seven crime categories - known as Index Crimes or Part 1 crimes (or Part I sometimes) - are the ones used to measure crime in many criminology papers, even when the researchers have access to data that covers a broader selection of crimes than these.4 The crime data actually also includes the final crime, simple assault, though it is not included as an index crime and is, therefore, generally ignored by researchers - a relatively large flaw in most studies that well discuss in more detail later. If you think that decisions made nearly a century ago are probably not the most useful for current research - and theyre almost certainly not the decisions that you would have made - then youve struck at the core of this book. As researchers, we are relying on datasets whose creation was made so long ago that 2.1 What is a crime? UCR data covers only a subset - and for the crime data, a very small subset - of all crimes that can occur. 2.1.1 Crimes included in the UCR datasets As mentioned above - and as most criminology papers will tell you - the crimes included in the UCRs Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data (which I like to call the crime dataset) are the seven index crimes (eight when including arson) - homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft - and simple assault. This is true but incomplete. The data also includes subcategories for all crimes other than theft - though theft has its own UCR dataset which goes into detail about the thefts. Both robbery and aggravated assault, for example, have subcategories showing which weapon the offender used (if any) during the crime. This allows for a more detailed understanding of the crime than looking only at the broad category. Im not sure why most research includes only the broader categories and doesnt tend to look at subcategories, but that seems to be the case in most studies that I have read. Some police agencies only report the broader categories and dont report subcategories, but most report subcategories so this is an under-exploited source of data. Homicide Murder and non-negligent manslaughter Manslaughter by negligence Rape Rape Attempted rape Robbery With a firearm With a knife of cutting instrument With a dangerous weapon not otherwise specified Unarmed - using hands, fists, feet, etc. Aggravated Assault (assault with a weapon or causing serious bodily injury) With a firearm With a knife of cutting instrument With a dangerous weapon not otherwise specified Unarmed - using hands, fists, feet, etc. Burglary With forcible entry Without forcible entry Attempted burglary with forcible entry Theft (other than of a motor vehicle) Motor Vehicle Theft Cars Trucks and buses Other vehicles Arson Simple Assault The crimes included in the Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race - the arrest data tells you how many people were arrested for a particular crime category - are different than those in the crime data. The arrest data covers a wider variety of crimes, including drug and alcohol crimes, gambling, and fraud. However, it is also less detailed than the crime dataset when it comes to violent crime. While it covers the same broad categories of violent crimes as the crimes data - murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault - it doesnt include the more detailed breakdown that is available in the crime data. For example, in the crime data robbery is included as well as the subcategories of robbery with a gun, robbery with a knife, robbery with another dangerous weapon, and robbery without a weapon. In comparison, the arrest data only includes robbery without any subcategories. Homicide Murder and non-negligent manslaughter Manslaughter by negligence Rape Robbery Aggravated assault Burglary Theft (other than of a motor vehicle) Motor vehicle theft Simple assault Arson Forgery and counterfeiting Fraud Embezzlement Stolen property - buying, receiving, possessing Vandalism Weapons offenses - carrying, possessing, etc. Prostitution and commercialized vice Sex offenses - other than rape or prostitution Drug abuse violations - total Drug sale or manufacturing Opium and cocaine, and their derivatives (including morphine and heroin) Marijuana Synthetic narcotics Other dangerous non-narcotic drugs Drug possession Opium and cocaine, and their derivatives (including morphine and heroin) Marijuana Synthetic narcotics Other dangerous non-narcotic drugs Gambling - total Bookmaking - horse and sports Number and lottery All other gambling Offenses against family and children - nonviolent acts against family members. Includes neglect or abuse, nonpayment of child support or alimony. Driving under the influence (DUI) Liquor law violations - Includes illegal production, possession (e.g. underage) or sale of alcohol, open container or public use laws. Does not include DUIs and drunkenness. Drunkenness - i.e. public intoxication Disorderly conduct Vagrancy - includes begging, loitering (for adults only), homelessness, and being a suspicious person. All other offenses (other than traffic) - a catch-all category for any arrest that is not otherwise specified in this list. Does not include traffic offenses. Very wide variety of crimes are included - use caution when using! Suspicion - Arrested for no specific offense and released without formal charges being placed. Curfew and loitering law violations - for minors only. Runaways - for minors only. 2.1.2 What is an index (or part 1) crime? 2.1.3 What is a violent crime? An important consideration in using this data is defining what a violent crime is. One definition, and the one that I think makes the most sense, is that a violent crime is one that uses force or the threat of force. For example, if I punch you in the face, that is a violent crime. If I stab you, that is a violent crime. While clearly different in terms of severity, both incidents used force so I believe would be classified as a violent crime. The FBI, and most researchers, reporters, and advocates would disagree. Organizations ranging from the FBI itself to Pew Research Center and advocacy groups like the Vera Institute of Justice and the ACLU all define the first examine as a non-violent crime and the second as a violent crime. They do this for three main reasons. The second reason is that it benefits some peoples goals to classify violent crime as only including index crimes. This is because simple assault is extremely common compared to violent index crimes - in most cities simple assault is more common than all violent index crimes put together - so excluding simple assault makes it seem like fewer arrests are violent than they are when including simple assault. For example, a number of articles have noted that marijuana arrests are more common than violent crime arrests (Ingraham 2016; Kertscher 2019; Devito 2020; Earlenbaugh 2020; Edwards et al. 2020) or that violent crime arrests are only 5% of all arrests (Neusteter and OToole 2019; Speri 2019). While true when considering only violent index crimes, including simple assault as a violent crime makes these statements false. Some organizations call the violent index crimes serious violent crimes which is an improvement but even this is a misnomer since simple assault can lead to more serious harm than aggravated assault. An assault becomes aggravated if using a weapon or there is the potential for serious harm, even if no harm actually occurs. The third reason 2.2 A summary of each UCR dataset UCR data can be roughly summarized into two groups: crime data and arrest data. While there are several datasets included in the UCR data collection, they are all extensions of one of the above groups. For arrest data, you have information about who (by race and by age-gender, but not by race-gender or race-age other than within race you know if the arrestee is an adult or a juvenile). For crime data, you have monthly counts of a small number of crimes (many fewer than crimes covered in the arrest data) and then more specialized data on a subset of these crimes - information on homicides, hate crimes, assaults or deaths of police officers, and stolen property. Each of these datasets will have its own chapter in this book where we discuss the data thoroughly. Here is a very brief summary of each dataset which will help you know which one to use for your research. I still recommend reading that datas chapter since it covers important caveats and uses (or misuses) of the data that wont be covered below. For example, 2.2.1 Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest (Return A) This dataset is the oldest and most widely used of the UCR datasets. It covers 2.2.2 Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA) 2.2.3 Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) 2.2.4 Hate Crime Data 2.2.5 Property Stolen and Recovered (Supplement to Return A) 2.2.6 Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race 2.3 The data as you get it from the FBI Well finish this overview of the UCR data by briefly talking about format of the data that is released by the FBI, before the processing done by myself or NACJD that converts the data to a type that software like R or Stata or Excel can understand. The FBI releases their data as fixed-width ASCII files which are basically just an Excel file but with all of the columns squished together. As an example, below is the data as you receive it from the FBI for the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset for 1960, the first year with data available. In the figure, it seems like there are multiple rows but thats just because the software that I opened the file in isnt wide enough - in reality what is shown is a single row that is extremely wide because there are over 1,500 columns in this data. If you scroll down enough youll see the next row, but that isnt shown in the current image. What is shown is a single row with a ton of columns all pushed up next to each other. Since all of the columns are squished together (the gaps are just blank spaces because the value there is a space, but that doesnt mean there is a in the data. Spaces are possible values in the data and are meaningful), you need some way to figure out which parts of the data belong in which column. Figure 2.1: Fixed-width ASCII file for the 1960 Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset The fixed-width part of the file type is how this works (the ASCII part basically means its a text file). Each row is the same width - literally the same number of characters, including blank spaces. So you must tell the software you are using to process this file - by literally write code in something called a setup file but is basically just instructions for whatever software you use (R, SPSS, Stata, SAS can all do this) - which characters are certain columns. For example, in this data the first character says which type of UCR data it is (1 means the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data) and the next two characters (in the setup file written as 2-3 since it is characters 2 through 3 [inclusive]) are the state number (01 is the state code for Alabama). So we can read this row as the first column indicating it is an Offenses Known data, the second column indicating that it is for the state of Alabama, and so on for each of the remaining columns. To read in this data youll need a setup file that covers every column in the data (some software, like R, can handle just reading in the specific columns you want and dont need to include every column in the setup file). The second important thing to know about reading in a fixed-width ASCII file is something called a value label.5 For example, in the above image we saw the characters 2-3 is the state and in the row we have the value 01 which means that the state is Alabama. Since this type of data is trying to be as small as efficient as possible, it often replaces longer values with shorter one and provides a translation for the software to use to convert it to the proper value when reading it. Alabama is more characters than 01 so it saves space to say 01 and just replace that with Alabama later on. So 01 would be the value\" and Alabama would be the label that it changes to once read. Fixed-width ASCII files may seem awful to you reading it today, and it is awful to use. But it appears to be an efficient way to store data back many decades ago when data releases began but now is extremely inefficient - in terms of speed, file size, ease of use - compared to modern software so Im not sure why they still release data in this format. But they do, and even the more modern (if starting in 1991, before I was born, is modern!) NIBRS data comes in this format. For you, however, the important part to understand is not how exactly to read this type of data, but to understand that people who made this data publicly available (such as myself and the team at NACJD) must made this conversion process.6 This conversion process, from fixed-width ASCII to a useful format is the most dangerous step taken in using this data - and one that is nearly entirely unseen by researchers. Every line of code you write (or, for SPSS users, click you make) invites the possibility of making a mistake.7 The FBI does not provide a setup file with the fixed-width ASCII data so to read in this data you need to make it yourself. Since some UCR data are massive, this involves assigning the column width for thousands of columns and the value labels for hundreds of different value labels.8 A typo anywhere could have potentially far-reaching consequences so this is a crucial weakpoint in the data cleaning process - and one in which I have not seen anything written about before. While I have been diligent in checking the setup files and my code to seek out any issues - and I know that NACJD has a robust checking process for their own work - that doesnt mean our work is perfect.9 Even with perfection in processing the raw data to useful files, decisions we make (e.g. what level to aggregate to, what is an outlier) can affect both what type of questions you can ask when using this data, and how well you can answer them. Arson is also an index crime but was added after these initial seven were chosen and is not included in the crimes dataset (though is available separately) so is generally not included in studies that use index crimes. For most fixed-width ASCII files there are also missing values where itll have placeholder value such as -8 and the setup file will instruct the software to convert that to NA. UCR data, however, does not have this and does not indicate when values are missing in this manner. For those interested in reading in this type of data, please see my R package asciiSetupReader. Even highly experienced programmers who are doing something like can make mistakes. For example, if you type out 2+2 100 times - something extremely simple that anyone can do - how often will you mistype a character and get a wrong result? Id guess that at least once youd make a mistake. With the exception of the arrest data and some value label changes in hate crimes and homicide data, the setup files remain consistent you a single file will work for all years for a given dataset. You do not need to make a setup file for each year. For evidence of this, please see any of the openICPSR pages for my detail as they detail changes Ive made in the data such as decisions on what level to aggregate to and mistakes that I made and later found and fixed.

These are unique ID codes used to identify an agency. If we used the agencys name wed end up with some duplicates For example, if you looked for the Philadelphia Police Department using the agency name, youd find both the Philadelphia Police Department in Pennsylvania and the one in Mississippi. Each ORI is a 7-digit value starting with the state abbreviation (for some reason the FBI incorrectly puts the abbreviation for Nebraska as NB instead of NE) followed by 5 numbers. In the NIBRS data (another FBI data set) the ORI uses a 9-digit code - expanding the 5 numbers to 7 numbers. When dealing with specific agencies, make sure to use the ORI rather than the agency name to avoid any mistakes. For an easy way to find the ORI number of an agency, use this site. Type an agency name or an ORI code into the search section and it will return everything that is a match. 3.6 Hierarchy Rule This dataset uses what is called the Hierarchy Rule where only the most serious crime in an incident is reported (except for motor vehicle theft, which is always included). For example if there is an incident where the victim is robbed and then murdered, only the murder is counted as it is considered more serious than the robbery. How much does this affect our data in practice? Actually relatively little. Though the Hierarchy Rule does mean this data is an under-count, data from other sources indicate that it isnt much of an under count. The FBIs other data set, the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) contains every crime that occurs in an incident (i.e. it doesnt use the Hierarchy Rule). Using this we can measure how many crimes the Hierarchy Rule excludes (Most major cities do not report to NIBRS so what we find in NIBRS may not apply to them). In over 90% of incidents, only one crime is committed. Additionally, when people talk about crime they usually mean murder which, while incomplete to discuss crime, means the UCR data here is accurate on that measure. 3.7 Which crimes are included? If you look back at the output when we ran names(offenses_known_yearly_1960_2017) youll see that it produced five broad categories of columns. The first was information about the agency including population and geographic info, then came four columns with the same values except starting with actual, tot_clr, clr_18, and unfound. Following these starting values were 30 crime categories. Well discuss what each of those starting values mean in a bit, lets first talk about which crimes are included and what that means for research. 3.7.1 Index Crimes The Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data set contains information on the number of Index Crimes (sometimes called Part I crimes) reported to each agency. These index crimes are a collection of eight crimes that, for historical reasons based largely by perceived importance in the 1920s when the UCR program was first developed, are used as the primary measure of crime today. Other data sets in the UCR, such as the Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race data and the Hate Crime data have more crimes reported. The crimes are, in order by the Hierarchy Rule - Homicide Murder and non-negligent manslaughter Manslaughter by negligence Rape Rape Attempted rape Robbery With a firearm With a knife of cutting instrument With a dangerous weapon not otherwise specified Unarmed - using hands, fists, feet, etc. Aggravated Assault (assault with a weapon or causing serious bodily injury) With a firearm With a knife of cutting instrument With a dangerous weapon not otherwise specified Unarmed - using hands, fists, feet, etc. Burglary With forcible entry Without forcible entry Attempted burglary with forcible entry Theft (other than of a motor vehicle) Motor Vehicle Theft Cars Trucks and buses Other vehicles Arson Simple Assault For a full definition of each of the index crimes see the FBIs Offense Definitions page here. Arson is considered an index crime but is not reported in this data - you need to use the separate Arson data set of the UCR to get access to arson counts. The ninth crime on that list, simple assault, is not considered an index crime but is nevertheless included in this data. Each of the crimes in the list above, and their subcategories, are included in the UCR data. In most reports, however, youll see them reported as the total number of index crimes, summing up categories 1-7 and reporting that as crime. These index crimes are often divided into violent index crimes - murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault - and property index crimes - burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft. 3.7.2 The problem with using index crimes The biggest problem with index crimes is that it is simply the sum of 8 (or 7 since arson data usually isnt available) crimes. Index crimes have a huge range in their seriousness - it includes both murder and theft. This is clearly wrong as 100 murders is more serious than 100 thefts. This is especially a problem as less serious crimes (theft mostly) are far more common than more serious crimes (in 2017 there were 1.25 million violent index crimes in the United States. That same year had 5.5 million thefts.). So index crimes under-count the seriousness of crimes. Looking at total index crimes is, in effect, mostly just looking at theft. This is especially a problem because it hides trends in violent crimes. San Francisco, as an example, has had a huge increase in index crimes in the last several years. When looking closer, that increase is driven almost entirely by the near doubling of theft since 2011. During the same years, violent crime has stayed fairly steady. So the city isnt getting more dangerous but it appears like it is due to just looking at total index crimes. Many researchers divide index crimes into violent and nonviolent categories, which helps but is still not entirely sufficient. Take Chicago as an example. It is a city infamous for its large number of murders. But as a fraction of index crimes, Chicago has a rounding error worth of murders. Their 653 murders in 2017 is only 0.5% of total index crimes. For violent index crimes, murder makes up 2.2%. What this means is that changes in murder are very difficult to detect. If Chicago had no murders this year, but a less serious crime (such as theft) increased slightly, we couldnt tell from looking at the number of index crimes. 3.7.3 Rape definition change The FBI changed the definition of rape for UCR data starting in 2013 to a broader definition than the older definition, which is commonly called the legacy definition or legacy or historical rape. The legacy definition is the carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will (emphasis added). This means that only rape is only included in UCR data when it is a female (or any age, there is no differentiation for child victims) forcibly vaginally penetrated by a penis. This is a narrow definition and excludes a number of sexual acts that people may consider rape such as forced oral or sex, and cases with a male victim. The new (and current) definition penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. Starting in 2013, rape has a new, broader definition in the UCR to include oral and anal penetration (by a body part or object) and to allow men to be victims. The new definition is: Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. The previous definition included only forcible intercourse against a woman. This definition is far broader and is effectively any non-consensual sexual act. It also includes male victims though the data does not differentiate between male or female (or any other gender) victims. Both the current and legacy definitions exclude statutory rape and incest other than forcible incest. They both also include lack of consent as cases where the victim cannot give consent, such as if they are too young or are mentally or physically incapacitated - they specifically give the example of being temporarily incapacitated through drugs or alcohol. As this revised definition is broader than the original one post-2013, rape data is not comparable to pre-2013 data. 2013, however, is simply the year that the FBI changed the definition which means that agencies should have changed their reporting to the new definition. As might not be too surprising, not all agencies followed this requirement. Well look at three examples to show when there is clear evidence that the agency did change their definition in 2013, when its clear they did so a year later, and when its unclear exactly when they made the change. 3.8 Actual offenses, clearances, and unfounded offenses For each crime we have four different categories indicating the number of crimes actually committed, the number cleared, and the number determined to not have occurred. 3.8.1 Actual This is the number of offenses that occurred, simply a count of the number of crimes that month. For example if 10 people are murdered in a city the number of actual murders would be 10. 3.8.2 Total Cleared A crime is cleared when an offender is arrested or when the case is considered cleared by exceptional means. When a single offender for a crime is arrested, that crime is considered cleared. If multiple people committed a crime, only a single person must be arrested for it to be cleared, and as the UCR data is at the offense level, making multiple arrests for an incident only counts as one incident cleared. So if 10 people committed a murder and all 10 were arrested, it would report one murder cleared not 10. If only one of these people are arrested it would still report one murder cleared - the UCR does not even say how many people commit a crime. A crime is considered exceptionally cleared if the police can identify the offender, have enough evidence to arrest the offender, know where the offender is, but is unable to arrest them. Some examples of this are the death of the offender or when the victim refuses to cooperate in the case. Unfortunately this data does not differentiate between clearances by arrest or by exceptional means. For a comprehensive report on how this variable can be exploited to exaggerate clearance rates, see this report by ProPublica on exceptional clearances with rape cases. 3.8.3 Cleared Where All Offenders Are Under 18 This variable is very similar to Total Cleared except is only for offenses in which every offender is younger than age 18. 3.8.4 Unfounded An unfounded crime is one in which a police investigation has determined that the reported crime did not actually happen. For example if the police are called to a possible burglary but later find out that a burglary did not occur, they would put it down as 1 unfounded burglary. This is based on police investigation rather than the decision of any other party such as a coroner, judge, jury, or prosecutor. 3.9 Number of months reported UCR data is reported monthly though even agencies that decide to report their data may not do so every month. As we dont want to compare an agency which reports 12 months to one that reports fewer, the variable number_of_months_reported is way keep only agencies that report 12 months, or deal with those that report fewer. From our table() output it seems that when agencies do report, they tend to do so for all 12 months of the year. However, this variable is seriously flawed, and its name is quite misleading. In reality this variable is actually just whichever the last month reported was. If an agency reported every month of the year, meaning December is the last month, they would have a value of 12. If the agency only reported in December, they would also have a value of 12. While there are ways in the monthly data to measure actual number of months reported, these ways are also flawed. So be cautious about this data and particularly the value of this variable.

And second it measures how many officers were assaulted or killed (including officers who die accidentally such as in a car crash) in a given month - this is broken down into shift type and type (e.g. alone, with a partner, on foot, in a car, etc.), the offenders weapon, and type of call they are responding to (e.g. robbery, disturbance, traffic stop). The employee information is at the year-level so you know, for example, how many male police officers were employed in a given year at an agency, but dont know any more than that such as how many officers were on patrol, were detectives, were in special units, etc. This dataset is commonly used as a measure of police employees and is a generally reliable - though imperfect as well see - measure of how many police are employed by a police agency. The second part of this data, measuring assaults and deaths, is more flawed with missing data issues and data error issues (e.g. more officers killed than employed in an agency). Well get into these issues in more detail during this chapter. This data, as well as the privately-run site Officer Down Memorial Page which covers law enforcement officers who have died, has also been used lately in the context of police using force against people out of fear of being harmed by that person. The discussion revolves around whether police are actually in high danger of being harmed by comparing the rate at which officers die to that of other professions. In general they find that police officers are among the most likely profession to die but are not at the top of this measure. 5.1 A brief history of the data 5.1.1 Changes in definitions 5.2 What does the data look like? 5.3 What variables are in the data? 5.3.1 Key variables 5.4 Known issues with the data 5.5 Final thoughts This data is also sometimes called the Police Employees dataset.

It also tells you the weapon used by each offender and the circumstance of the killing, such as a lovers triangle or a gang-related murder. As with other UCR data, it also tells you the agency it occurred in and the month and year when the crime happened.

Since this data is voluntary to This If this most detailed dataset sounds disappointing - and it is! - 6.1 A brief history of the data The data is available from the FBI starting in 1975 though, unlike all later years, this year only has information on a single victim and a single offender.

The first part is key, they must be crimes - and really must be the selection of crimes that the FBI collects for this dataset. Biased actions that dont meet the standard of a crime, or are of a crime not included in this data, are not considered hate crimes. For example, if someone yells at a Black person and uses racial slurs against them, it is clearly a racist action. For it to be included in this data, however, it would have to extend to a threat since intimidation is a crime included in this data but lesser actions such as simply insulting someone is not included. For the second part, the bias motivation, it must be against a group that the FBI includes in this data. When this data collection began crimes against transgender people were not counted so if a transgender person was assaulted or killed because they were transgender, this is not a hate crime recorded in the data.12 So this data is really a more narrow measure of hate crimes than it might seem. In practice it is (some) crimes motivated by (some) kinds of hate that are reported to the police. It is also the most under-reported UCR dataset with most agencies not reporting any crimes to the FBI. This leads to huge gaps in the data with some states having zero agencies report crime, agencies reporting some bias motivations but not others, agencies reporting some years but not others. While these problems exist for all of the UCR datasets, it is most severe in this data. This problem is exacerbated by hate crimes being rare even in agencies that report them - with such rare events, even minor changes in which agencies report or which types of offenses they include can have large effects. My main takeaway for this data is that it is inappropriate to use it to study hate crimes. At most it can be used to look at within-city within-bias-motivation trends, while keeping in mind that even this narrow subset of data is limited by under-reporting by victims and potential changes in police practices of reporting such as how many months of data they report per year. 7.1 A brief history of the data 7.1.1 Changes in definitions 7.2 What does the data look like? 7.2.1 Raw data 7.3 What variables are in the data? 7.3.1 Key variables 7.4 Known issues with the data 7.5 Final thoughts The first year where transgender as a group was a considered a bias motivation was in 2014.
